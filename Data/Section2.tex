    \item As for participating fully (in spirit and actuality) and professionally, we should attend every meeting on time and emphasize that everyone must do their job independently and utilize their technical skills.
    \item As for the rule "Each member should abiding the rules of academic honesty", if anyone cheated or disobeyed academic honesty, we will warn for the first time and even repel him if the situation is serious.
