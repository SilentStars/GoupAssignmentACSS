\section{Feedback explanation}
We've received a lot of feedback from another group of students and contains valuable suggestions. Here is a list of feedbacks we received and our explanation attach to it:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Syntax error
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Explanation: This is something we should find out in the first place. Still, thanks for your patient in pointing out those issues!
    \end{itemize}
    \item Unclear about the Chinese questionnaire platform WenJuanXing
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Explanation: We added a few lines to introduce that platform. It is essential to give enough information to the reader.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Didnâ€™t describe your target group for surveys in the result section
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Explanation: It is crucial to have the reader information sync with us, so we add a few sentences when we are talking about the target.
    \end{itemize}
    \item The abstract is not yet clear
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Explanation: The abstract is a pretty vital section to notify the reader what this article is about and have the article's critical point to be clear out. So we added a few lines to it. We hope it will make it more evident than before.
    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
