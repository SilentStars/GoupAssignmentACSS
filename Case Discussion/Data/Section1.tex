  			\item Hao Sun: 
  			\item Qinhan Hou:
  			\item Yifan Liu: I agree with Aisha considering that the quality of work is important, so the first thing should do is to focus on the main feature and its quality. And I also disagree with Srinivas. I think that open-source software is great for personal development but as a product, we still need time to go through the code, and it's a time-consuming thing to do so. On the other hand, this is an anti-LGTBQ+ right organization support community, so it's better not to get involved with them. 
  			And that is also the ACM Code of Ethics suggests us to do, we need to be fair and take action not to discriminate.
  			\item Zezhong Zhang: I agree with aisha's idea, because the software needs to ensure the availability and integrity of the main functionality, so that it can be completed before the deadline while ensuring a certain degree of experience and functionality. As for Javier' idea, the disadvantage is that some functions are incomplete which have an impact on user experience. Linnea's idea is good, but resetting the release time makes people lose patience and confidence about the software. So it is better to release software with main functions and then improve it step by step so that users could accept it easier. Srinivas' idea is risky, maybe using the open-source software made by the company that had support with anti-LGBT rights behavior could cause the public to have a bad impression on the product, which will be terrible when promoting. And according to ACM Code of Ethics, we should be fair and take action not to discriminate.
