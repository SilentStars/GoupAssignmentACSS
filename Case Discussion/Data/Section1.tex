		\subsubsection{Standpoint of each member}
		\begin{itemize}
  			\item Hao Sun: 
  			\item Qinhan Hou:
  			\item Yifan Liu: I agree with Aisha considering that the quality of work is important, so the first thing should do is to focus on the main feature and its quality. And I also disagree with Srinivas. I think that open-source software is great for personal development but as a product, we still need time to go through the code, and it's a time-consuming thing to do so. On the other hand, this is an anti-LGTBQ+ right organization support community, so it's better not to get involved with them.
